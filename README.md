# Creating a Convoluted Neural Network with pytorch. Exercise N.2

Exercise with the make_circles toy dataset practicing neural networks.
Based on the learnpytorch.io books I created a binary classification model that divides circles int an inner and outer circumference. 

Files included:

- neural_network.ipynb = contains the model, loss function, optimizer, test and training datasets and some gradual improvements I made to the model.
